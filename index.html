      How bad will Trump 2.0 be?
    </p>
    <img src="img/Donald Trump.webp" alt="">
    <p class="text">
      Four years ago, Donald Trump called on his supporters to storm the Capitol – in just under two weeks he will take office as US President for the second time. What should the world prepare for?
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      ​​It is exactly four years since Donald Trump incited a violent mob to storm the most important parliament building in the USA. More than 1000 participants in the storming of the Capitol have since been charged. It is unclear how many of the hundreds of convicted and imprisoned Trump will pardon; Steve Benen of MSNBC describes well how the story of January 6th has long been reinterpreted by the Republicans. But the question of whether Trump will take this bold step is only part of a much larger debate.
      Since the election, Trump's opponents and millions of people around the world have been asking themselves: How bad will it get now, Trump 2.0?
      And with that, welcome to the first US Radar of the new year, which is not about making any definitive statements about the next four years - the new man in the White House is too unpredictable for that. But we will summarize the discussion in three important areas and describe why some believe that the USA and the world are facing unprecedented political upheavals and why others consider such fears to be alarmism.
      So let us look at Trump's program, the institutions that support him, and who will be in charge there in the future.

    <p class="title"> political program</p>

      Trump plans extremes in migration, world trade and public finances, …
      Author Maya Angelou once said, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” To many, this saying seems to fit Donald Trump perfectly.
      At New York Magazine's The Cut, Andrea González-Ramirez gives her essay a grim headline: "Don't downplay how bad Trump 2.0 will be." She lists: "I'm simply repeating what Trump & Co. have already announced: mass deportations, a nationwide abortion ban, trans people as targets, tax cuts for the rich and political opponents in prison."
      That sounds like US domestic politics and would be extreme enough in itself. But Trump's list of priorities is long and many things could affect Germany, for example exports, climate policy and the postponement of what is politically conceivable.
      On the subject of tariffs: The USA is clearly the most important export nation for Germany. If German products become more expensive in the United States, this could have a serious impact on the already weak German economy. It is still unclear exactly which tariffs will be imposed.
